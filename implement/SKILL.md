Implement a feature by reading all prepared context, then commit, push, and create a PR.

## Branch Setup

- **In a worktree** (sibling directory with a feature branch already checked out) → work in the current directory
- **On main** → invoke the `feature-branch` skill (via `Skill` tool) with the issue number as argument, then `cd` into the created worktree before continuing

## Steps

1. Resolve the issue — the argument can be:
   - A **GitHub issue number or URL** → fetch with `gh issue view`
   - A **description** → search with `gh issue list --search "<description>"` to find the matching issue
   - Nothing → ask the user what to implement

2. Read all available context:
   - Specs in `doc/spec/` related to the feature
   - ADRs in `doc/adr/` related to the feature
   - Docs in `doc/` related to the feature
   - Existing code and tests in the affected areas

3. Implement the feature based on the gathered context:
   - Follow specs as acceptance criteria
   - Respect architectural decisions from ADRs
   - Match existing code style and patterns

4. When implementation is complete — commit, push, and create a PR:
   - Stage relevant files — prefer `git add <file>...` over `git add -A`
   - Do NOT stage files that look like secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens)
   - Extract the issue number from the current branch name (e.g. `42-add-export` → `#42`)
   - Commit with message: `#<number> <imperative summary>`
   - Push with `git push -u origin <branch>`
   - Create PR with `gh pr create`:
     - Title: imperative, under 70 chars
     - Body includes "Closes #<number>" to auto-link the issue
   - Show the PR URL when done

## Rules

- Follow commit message convention: `#<number> <imperative summary>`
- If there are no changes to commit, tell the user
