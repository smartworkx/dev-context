Create a new Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `doc/adr/` using the Nygard format.

## Steps

1. If the user did not provide a decision title as an argument, ask them for one
2. Convert the title to kebab-case for the filename
3. Use today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) as prefix: `doc/adr/YYYY-MM-DD-kebab-case-title.md`
4. Create the file with this template:

```markdown
# [Title]

**Status:** proposed
**Date:** [today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format]

## Context

[What is the issue? What forces are at play? What is the background?]

## Decision

[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences

[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
Include positive, negative, and neutral consequences.]
```

6. Tell the user the file was created and its path
7. Remind them: "ADRs are immutable once accepted — to change a decision, supersede it with a new ADR."
