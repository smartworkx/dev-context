Create a feature branch in a new git worktree, as a sibling directory of the current project.

## Rules

- **Never use `git checkout -b` or `git switch -c` in the main working directory.** All feature branches must be created as worktrees using `git worktree add`. The main directory must always stay on the main branch.
- Never generate a branch name — always take it from the user or the issue number.

## Steps

1. Take the branch name from the argument. If none provided, ask the user — never generate a name.

2. Fetch the latest main:
   - `git fetch origin main`

3. Create the worktree:
   - `git worktree add ../<branch-name> -b <branch-name> origin/main`
   - This creates `../<branch-name>/` alongside the current project directory

4. Confirm to the user:
   - Show the branch name
   - Show the worktree path
